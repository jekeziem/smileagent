                <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">1. About SmileAgent</h2>
                <p>SmileAgent is a dental triage and booking platform that helps patients in Ireland find and connect with dental clinics. By using SmileAgent ("the Service"), you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- 2. Not Medical Advice -->
            <section class="bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded-xl p-4">
                <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">2. SmileAgent Is Not a Medical Service</h2>
                <p><strong>SmileAgent does not diagnose, treat, or provide medical advice.</strong></p>
                <p class="mt-2">Our emergency triage tool uses a rules-based system adapted from established clinical triage principles to estimate urgency and route you to appropriate care. It is not a substitute for professional medical or dental assessment.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>Triage results are <strong>guidance only</strong> — they are not a clinical diagnosis</li>
                    <li>Self-care tips are general information, not personalised medical advice</li>
                    <li>If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call <strong>999</strong> or go to A&amp;E immediately</li>
                    <li>Always follow the advice of a qualified dental or medical professional</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- 3. Eligibility -->
            <section>
                <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">3. Eligibility</h2>
                <p>You must be at least 18 years old to use SmileAgent. By using the Service, you confirm that you are 18 or older and are legally capable of entering into a binding agreement.</p>

            <!-- 4. How the Service Works -->
            <section>
                <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">4. How the Service Works</h2>
                <p>SmileAgent connects you with dental clinics. When you submit a booking request or emergency referral:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>We forward your details to the clinic you selected</li>
                    <li>The clinic reviews your request and contacts you directly</li>
                    <li><strong>Submitting a request does not guarantee an appointment.</strong> Availability is subject to the clinic's review and capacity</li>
                    <li>Your relationship for treatment is directly with the clinic, not with SmileAgent</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- 5. Pricing -->
            <section>
                <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">5. Pricing and Estimates</h2>
                <p>All prices displayed on SmileAgent are <strong>estimates only</strong>, sourced from publicly available information and clinic-provided data. Final treatment costs will be confirmed by the dentist after your consultation.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">Med 2 tax relief calculations are estimates based on the standard 20% rate. SmileAgent does not guarantee eligibility — this is determined by Revenue and your individual tax circumstances.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">SmileAgent does not collect payment from patients. All payment is made directly between you and the clinic.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- 6. AI Analysis -->
            <section>
                <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">6. AI Smile Analysis</h2>
                <p>The optional AI smile analysis feature provides a general assessment to help guide treatment selection. It is <strong>not a clinical examination</strong> and should not be relied upon as a diagnosis. A qualified dentist will assess your specific needs during consultation.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- 7. Clinic Information -->
            <section>
                <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">7. Clinic Information Accuracy</h2>
                <p>Clinic details (addresses, phone numbers, opening hours, pricing, Medical Card status, PRSI acceptance) are sourced from publicly available information and verified periodically. However, this information can change without notice.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">SmileAgent makes reasonable efforts to keep clinic data accurate but <strong>does not guarantee</strong> the accuracy, completeness, or currency of any clinic information displayed. We recommend confirming details directly with the clinic before attending.</p>
